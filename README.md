# I am a noob. This is a my first project.

This is my attempt at creating a digital version of cards against humanity. 

Play it **[HERE](https://utterly-flummoxed.github.io/Misanthrocards/)**.

Each player uses their own device to generate cards, and use the generated cards to play the game together irl.

If you like it, please show your friends or share it online. 

I'm open to improvement suggestions.
